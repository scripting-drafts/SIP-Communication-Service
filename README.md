# A Communication Service based on UDP

Server: Run data_handler  
Client: Run conversational  

## How it works

**Client**: Listens voice -> Translates to text -> Relays text  
**Server**: Feeds text to Neural Network (microsoft/GODEL-v1_1-large-seq2seq)-> arbitrarily gets summarized (google/pegasus-xsum) -> logging proceeds -> Answers get relayed
**Client**: Speaks answers out loud  

### TODO

 - Make the generation of Files logging available to models that require a ground truth - Make Files autogenerated  
 - _Encrypt_ UDP  
 - Evolve from Backbone Edge Computing to Cloud Native
